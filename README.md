<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

<p>I created routes for all the pages, and then created a seed folder with every description of the product. Used JavaScript for the sizing on specific items.  I used a carousel that automatically scrolls through images by itself on the home page.  I used css grid for the images at the bottom labeled "Seen in the Streets" and also used css grid for most of the site for layout.  I used bootstrap for a lot of the editing.

<h3>Challenges</h3>

I did not get a chance to add a cart, so everything is sold out
